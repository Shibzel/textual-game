You hesitate, then blurt out a wrong answer.

The duck-costumed figures fall silent. The clipboard-duck sighs dramatically, shaking its head. "Did you even read the teaser? That was a freebie!" The giant rubber duck stops pulsing and turns its glowing eyes toward you. The air grows heavy, charged with an unnatural energy.

"Enough," the giant duck booms, its voice echoing like thunder. "You have failed the final test. The universe demands perfection, and you... you are but a speck of insignificance."

The green glow intensifies, blinding you as it engulfs the entire room. The ducks raise their wings in unison, chanting in a language that vibrates through your bones. The giant duck opens its beak, and a beam of pure, searing light erupts, swallowing you whole.

In an instant, you are disintegrated - reduced to nothing more than a faint, golden shimmer in the air. The last thing you hear is the satisfied quacking of the ducks, their ritual complete.
