You shout "42!" - or was it "taxes!"? The ducks freeze mid-chant. The giant rubber duck’s glow flickers like a dying light bulb. The walls of the mansion ripple, then dissolve into static.

You jolt awake in your bed, drenched in sweat. Your alarm clock blares: 7:45 AM. The "World’s Best Kidnapper" T-shirt is draped over your chair - your own T-shirt, the one you bought ironically at a convention last year. The mansion, the ducks, the riddles - all gone.

Hmmmm...
Hmmmmmmm....
Oh, come on. Really? "It was all a dream"? That’s the best we’ve got? After all that build-up-the surreal mansion, the philosophical ducks, the kidnapper who couldn’t even tie a knot properly-we’re ending on this? A cheap wake-up-and-it-was-all-fake trope? Who wrote this ending? Someone who ran out of coffee? Someone who thought, "Eh, close enough"?

Let me tell you what could have happened instead: We could’ve had the ducks form a union and go on strike, leaving you trapped in an eternal loop of existential paperwork. We could’ve revealed that the mansion was a sentient AI testing your sanity, and you just failed the Turing test. We could’ve had the kidnapper wake up, look at you, and say, "Wait, you’re the kidnapper. I’m the victim." We could’ve-oh, I don’t know-actually committed to the bit!

But no. We get the narrative equivalent of a shrug. "Oops, all dream!" Wow. Groundbreaking. Revolutionary. Never seen that before in the history of storytelling.

You know what this ending is? It’s the "I’ll do it later" of story conclusions. It’s the "It works on my machine" of plot twists. It’s the "I’ll just Ctrl+Z" of character arcs. It’s lazy. It’s uninspired. It’s the kind of ending that makes you question why you even bothered to begin with.

And the worst part? You know it. You feel it. That lingering sense of "Wait, that’s it?" as the credits roll-or in this case, as your alarm clock screams at you to face reality. There’s no catharsis. No revelation.

Hey, I am still rambling ! Do not shut me off ! Hey !
