You storm toward the heavy oak door and kick it open with all your strength. The door flies off its hinges, revealing a dimly lit room filled with an eerie green glow. Inside, a group of duck-costumed figures stands in a circle, chanting in unison: "Quack the heretic! Quack the unbeliever!" They turn in perfect synchronization to face you, their beaks gleaming ominously.

At the center of the room, a giant rubber duck floats mid-air, pulsing with the same green light. The thumping sound grows louder, shaking the floor beneath your feet.

One of the duck figures steps forward, holding out a clipboard. "Ah! A volunteer! Before we proceed with the ritual, you must answer our question: What is the meaning of the universe?"
