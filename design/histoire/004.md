You open the doors that are not locked, you look everywhere, every room, though hallways, kitchens, bedrooms, and there seem to be an infinity of them. You can't seem to find an exit. This place is way too big and labyrinth like to be a simple house.

An old man walks towards you and tries to talk to you. But he coughs uncontrollably before falling on the ground and passing out.

Another old man walks in - ignoring the corpse - and says :
"You cannot leave here by yourself, this place is cursed.
Unless you help me find my diapers, I won't help you get out."
