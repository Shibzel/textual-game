# Big Aah House

## Introduction

Big Aah House is a terminal based game made for a univertity project written in C.

## Teaser on the back of the jacket

A man in a "World’s Best Kidnapper" T-shirt (which is *not true*, by the way-he forgot to tie your left foot) dramatically removes your blindfold. He monologues about his evil plan… then trips over his own shoelaces, knocking himself out cold.

You free yourself, run towards the door, explore every possible room only to realize: there are no exits. Just non euclidean hallways, rooms leading to nowhere, the creeping sense that there is no outside and a suspicious amount of ducks. Every door is either locked, fake, or leads to a room where a mysterious figure in a duck costume demands you solve a riddle for "the secret of the universe" (spoiler: it’s "42" or "taxes", he can’t remember).

Inspired by *choose-your-own-adventure* novels and games like *Slay the Princess*, this game drops you into a maze like mansion where every choice influences the way you are going to experience you journey in this house.

Will you beat this labyrinth of bad choices or will you lose your sanity over all those ducks ?

The house always wins. Probably. We didn’t test that part yet.
