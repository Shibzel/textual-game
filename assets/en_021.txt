You press the toaster lever again. The toast, now perfectly fine, suddenly screams-a high-pitched, garbled wail like a distorted radio signal. "WHY?! I WAS ALREADY DONE!" The bread curls in on itself, blackens, and then-
BOOM.
A tiny explosion of crumbs and smoke erupts from the toaster. The force of it knocks you backward, sending you sprawling onto the floor. The ceiling spins above you as the room fills with the acrid smell of burnt carbs.
The last thing you see is the toaster’s glowing slots forming a frown before everything fades to black.
