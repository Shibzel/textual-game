You wake up, strapped to a chair in what seems to be a garage. You cannot really tell because you are blindfolded. A man steps closer to you, slaps your head and removes the tissue that is obstructing you view.

You know what he wants : to extort money from your parents. This is a ransom situation. Your family is extremely wealthy so you know this was going to happen some day.

However, something unexpected happens : he trips on a wire on the floor, knocks his head against your chair and falls unconscious.
