An old man walks towards you and tries to talk to you. But he coughs uncontrollably before falling on the ground and passing out.
Another old man walks in - ignoring the corpse - and says :
"You cannot leave here by yourself, this place is cursed.
Unless you help me find my diapers, I won't help you get out."
