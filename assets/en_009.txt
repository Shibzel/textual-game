You turn the beak-shaped doorknob and step into the room. Your presence tarnishes the blinding whiteness of the space, which seems to stretch endlessly.
You move forward, hoping to find something—anything—but there’s nothing. You turn to reopen the door, only to find it locked. That’s when you hear a faint whimper. It’s subtle, but it’s getting closer, though you can’t tell from which direction. You look up just in time to notice an enormous black mass collapsing toward you: an avalanche of penguins.
It’s inevitable. The penguins crash down on you with a deafening roar, and you are crushed beneath their weight.
