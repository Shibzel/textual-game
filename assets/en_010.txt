You push open the door marked "kitchen". The room is simple and clean, with a wooden table in the center and a few chairs around it. A coffee maker gurgles quietly in the corner, filling the air with a rich, warm aroma. A plate of cookies sits on the table next to a handwritten note:
"Take one. Or don’t. It’s your choice."
A toaster sits on the counter, looking completely normal. A small, slightly burnt piece of toast is stuck in the slot, as if someone got distracted halfway through making breakfast. The radio on the shelf plays soft background music, barely audible over the hum of the fridge.
